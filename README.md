Attempt to port PDP-11 LINKer to PC C/C++ â€” learning how the linker works, the hard way.

The code (partially) ported from MACRO-11 sources to C/C++.
Port source: RT-11 LINK V05.45.

## Status: Work in Progress ðŸš§

Currently the PCLINK11 links most of test OBJ files properly, but we have some troubles linking tests with libraries.

## Usage

The source code is able to compile under Windows (VS2013), and also under Linux/MacOS (gcc/clang, use the Makefile).

Command line:

`pclink11 <input files and options>`

Options (both `/` and `-` prefixes are allowed):
- `-EXECUTE:filespec` â€” Specifies the name of the memory image file
- `-NOBITMAP` `-X` â€” Do not emit bit map
- `-WIDE` `-W` â€” Produces a load map that is 132-columns wide
- `-ALPHABETIZE` `-A` â€” Lists global symbols on the link map in alphabetical order
- `-SYMBOLTABLE` `-STB` â€” Generates a symbol table file (.STB file)
- `-MAP` â€” Generates map file
- `-FORLIB` `-F` â€” Include FORLIB.OBJ
- `--version` â€” Show the program version information
- `--help` â€” Show quick help on the command line options

Input files and options are space-separated.

Examples:
- `pclink11 HELLO.OBJ` â€” link the object file, will produce `HELLO.SAV` executable
- `pclink11 -MAP -SYMBOLTABLE -EXECUTE:LD.SYS LD.OBJ SYSLIB.OBJ -X` â€” link object file with system library, produce map file and symbol file, save output as `LD.SYS`, do not put bitmap in the first block
- `pclink11 TEST1.OBJ TEST2.OBJ -MAP -WIDE -A` â€” link two object files, generate map file with wide format, alphabetize list of symbols

## Testing Strategy
Folder `tests` contains more than 100 sub-folders with .OBJ files.

First, we use [RT-11 simulator](http://emulator.pdp-11.org.ru/RT-11/distr/) written by Dmitry Patronov to produce "etalon" or "original" output files, they renamed with `-11` suffix â€” see `!runtest11.cmd` command file.
Then, we run the `pclink11` with to produce "our" output files, they renamed with `-my` suffix â€” see `!runtestmy.cmd` command file and `testrunner` utility.
And finally, we compare "original" files with "our" files, line-to-line or byte-to-byte, using `testanalyzer` utility.

"Our" MAP files differs in the first line (program name, date/time, no page number), and there's no paging, so no page header lines.
SAV/SYS/REL and STB files are binary, compared byte-to-byte, should be no differences.
Log files are absolutely different, we're not comparing them, but in "our" log files we're looking for "SUCCESS"/"ERROR" and so on.

## TODO

First priority:
- Fix bugs for the failing test cases

Second priority:
- Need more tests, currently we have 119 test cases
- Reduce amount of logging, add option for verbosity level
- Process other command-line options, including file-specific ones

Not implemented now, and not sure we will:
- Link for foreground execution with `-R` or `-FOREGROUND` option, produce .REL file
- LDA output â€” produce a file in absolute binary loader format (option `-L`)
- Overlays
- Linkage with separated instructions/data spaces
